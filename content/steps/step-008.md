title: Step 7 - Node.js
order: 8
---

Now it's time to install Node.js. Visit the [Node Homepage](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your system.

We need at least Node v10 so you can use LTS (v12) or Current (v14) without any problems.

Again, if you want to check if node is installed (and also check the version) you can run `node -v` in your terminal

```bash
node -v
```

Once you have installed Node you can run `node -v` in your terminal again to see if it is there. You might need to restart your terminal again for it to pick it up
