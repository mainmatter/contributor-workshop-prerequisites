#### Installing a browser

Several browsers provide us with tools that help us to develop our web application. In the scope of this workshop we'd like to use **Google Chrome**. If you haven't got it on your computer yet, you can download and install it over [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

We also recommend [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) if you are looking for an alternative.
