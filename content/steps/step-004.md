When working with Ember you will need to use the terminal. So before the workshop it is worth getting yourself a little bit familiar with your terminal. Let's start with opening it up: 

## On Mac

- Hit Command + Space key (to open spotlight)
- type "Terminal"
- hit enter

## on Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)

- * Hit Control + Alt + T

There are many different ways to open, if you not sure how feel free to ask one of the Mentors

## On Windows

- Open Visual Studio Code
- Click `Terminal` at the top of the screen
- Click `New Terminal`
