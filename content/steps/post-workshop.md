Now that we have everything installed correctly we will be ready to start working very fast at the workshop ðŸŽ‰

If you weren't able to get anything installed using this guide please remember to ask one of the mentors on the day of the workshop or reach out to us on Discord! They are here to help and all of them really want to see you succeed ðŸ™Œ

See you on October 16th for the main event!
