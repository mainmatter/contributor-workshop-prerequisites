title: Step 9 - GitHub Account
order: 9

The Ember project uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the codebases for its various projects, for example [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) itself, [Ember CLI](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli), or even the [Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source).
GitHub has [getting started](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github) documentation if you want to get more acquainted with it.

## Create an account

If you don't already have a GitHub account already you will need to sign up for a free account on the website [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

## Clone your first Ember repo

If you already have a GitHub account and you are comfortable cloning a repo then go ahead and clone [https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website) to your computer now.

If you have never cloned anything from GitHub before, by far the simplest way to get started is to install Github Desktop, which you can install from [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/).

Once you have GitHub Desktop installed you can click "Code > Open in GitHub Desktop" on any repo and it will ask you to clone it locally.

Once you have cloned the ember-website repo, you can navigate to the folder using your terminal and run `npm install` and then `npm start` to get it running
