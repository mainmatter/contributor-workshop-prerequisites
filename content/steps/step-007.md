title: Step 6 - Git
order: 7

Now we need to install Git. Visit the [Git Homepage](https://git-scm.com/) and download the installer for your system.

If you want to check to see if git is installed already on your computer you can run `git` in your terminal

```bash
git
```

If it tells you that git could not be found then we need to install it from the website

**Note:** if you're on Windows and it asks you if you would like git added to the `PATH` you should say yes.

Once you have installed Git you can run `git` in your terminal again to see if it is there. You might need to restart your terminal (or restart VS Code if you're on Windows)
