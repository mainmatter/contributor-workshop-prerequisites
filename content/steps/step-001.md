## How does this workshop work?

This workshop is about learning how to contribute to open source, and more specifically any of the many Ember projects. 

If you are already an expert or even starting out there are some tips to help you get the best out of this workshop: 

- Keep an open mind
- Be patient
- Help each other out
- Ask the mentors questions!
- Celebrate your successes today

Feel free to pair with one or two other people in the group. If you prefer working on your own, this is also great - see whatever works best for you!
